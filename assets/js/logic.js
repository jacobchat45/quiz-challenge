// timed quiz game
// starts on the start button being clicked
// timer which subtracts some time (10 sec) when a question is answered incorrectly
// next question is shown as soon as the one before is answered
// final score is questions answered + time remaining


// question = 0

// var currentQuestion = 0;

// after checking the answer, + this by one and then the next question should render


let correctAnswers;

for(i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    console.log(questions[i].correctAnsw);
    
}
console.log(correctAnswers);
// function renderQuestions(){
//     for (var a = 0; a < questions.length; a++){
//          console.log(questions[a].answers[0]);
//     }
// }
// question rendered depends on value
// value increases after question
